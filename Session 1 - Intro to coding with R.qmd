## Quarto

This is a Qurto document. Code lives in "chunks" like the one below. 

```{r}
# This is a code chunk. Let's load the packages (the machines) we need for this session:

library(tidyverse)
library(immunogenetr)
```

# Now that we've loaded the machines we'll need, let's run our first line of code:

```{r}
HLA_typing_1 %>% print()
```
